# Unit 06 HW: weather-dashboard

## Description
This project allows an user to search the weather information of specific city. The weather data is from the APIs provided by OpenWeather. From the API data, it collects the necessary weather information (weather condition, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index) per user's input (city). User's searched city data is stored in local storage and the buttons get created as user adds more cities. When user clicks one of the searched city buttons, then user is displayed with its city weather information again.

## Tasks Assigned

```
- When user searches the city, it displays the current weather condition and 5-Day forecast weather condition.
- Then, the city that user searched is added to the search history.
- In current weather condition container, it displays the date, weather condition icon, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index.
- Particularly, for UV index, I added color indicator based on the UV index level that provides user with important data.
- In 5-Day forecast weather condition container, it displays the date, weather condition icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day.
- When user clicks the searched city button, he/she is presented with weather information for that city again.
- As a developer, I need to utilize local storage data technique.
- I need to collect the weather data from OpenWeather API.
```
